# Product Manager - Project Plan Document

## 1. Understanding of Requirements

### Core Application Requirements
- ASP.NET Core MVC web application with two main pages
  - Product List: Managing product information
  - Report: Statistical analysis view
- Product entity structure with:
  - Product ID (unique identifier)
  - Name (product name)
  - Category (product category)
  - Price (product price)
  - Stock (available quantity)

### Technical Requirements
- Architecture Pattern Requirements:
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Service layer for business logic
  - Code-first approach using Entity Framework Core
  - Caching implementation with two types:
    - Long-term cache (until removal)
    - Short-term cache (5-minute duration)
  - Delegate implementation for callbacks

- Core Functionalities:
  - Complete CRUD operations for products
  - Category-based price averaging
  - Highest stock value category calculation

- Frontend Requirements:
  - Bootstrap/custom CSS styling
  - jQuery integration for enhanced interactivity

- Testing Requirements:
  - MSTest framework implementation
  - Mock objects for dependency isolation
  - Service layer testing focus

## 2. Solution Planning

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
1. Project Structure Setup
   - Create layered architecture
   - Set up project dependencies
   - Configure development environment

2. Database Design
   - Entity design
   - Database context setup
   - Migration configuration

### Phase 2: Core Features (Days 4-7)
1. Data Access Layer
   - Repository implementation
   - Database operations setup
   - Query optimization

2. Business Logic Layer
   - Service layer implementation
   - Caching mechanism setup
   - Business rules implementation

### Phase 3: UI Development (Days 8-10)
1. Frontend Structure
   - View implementation
   - Layout design
   - Responsive design setup

2. User Interface Features
   - CRUD operations interface
   - Reporting interface
   - Interactive elements

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Days 11-14)
1. Testing Implementation
   - Unit test setup
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

2. Final Refinements
   - Bug fixing
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation completion

## 3. Potential Development Issues

### Technical Challenges
1. Data Management
   - Cache synchronization issues
   - Data consistency during concurrent operations
   - Performance with large datasets

2. Architecture Complexity
   - Maintaining separation of concerns
   - Managing dependencies
   - Ensuring scalability

3. Integration Challenges
   - Cache and database synchronization
   - Frontend and backend integration
   - Testing environment setup

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Data Management
   - Implement proper cache invalidation
   - Use concurrency control
   - Implement data pagination

2. Architecture
   - Regular architecture reviews
   - Clear documentation
   - Consistent coding standards

3. Integration
   - Comprehensive integration testing
   - Clear interface definitions
   - Regular deployment testing

## 4. Logic Structure (Pseudo Logic)

### Product Management Logic
1. Product Creation Flow
   - Validate input data
   - Check category existence
   - Store data
   - Update cache
   - Notify relevant components

2. Product Retrieval Flow
   - Check cache
   - If not in cache, retrieve from database
   - Update cache if necessary
   - Return formatted data

3. Reporting Logic
   - Calculate average prices
     * Group products by category
     * Calculate averages
     * Cache results
   
   - Determine highest stock value
     * Calculate stock values
     * Group by category
     * Identify maximum
     * Cache results

4. Cache Management Logic
   - Long-term cache handling
   - Short-term cache handling
   - Cache invalidation rules

## 5. Development Implementation Plan

### 1: Foundation
- Day 1-2: Project setup and architecture
- Day 3-4: Database and repository setup
- Day 5: Basic service implementation

### 2: Core Development
- Day 1-2: CRUD operations

- Day 4-5: Refinement and documentation

### Quality Checkpoints
1. Code architecture review
2. Database design review
3. Unit test coverage check
4. UI/UX review
5. Performance testing
